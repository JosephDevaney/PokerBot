Solution PokerBotGUI:
	Card.cs - 100%
	Deck.cs - 95%
		The LoadDeckImages() is very similiar to an example on StackOverflow
	Hand.cs - 100%
	HandEvaluator.cs - 100%
	MyImage.cs - 100%
		Got the idea from StackOverflow question on loading images for use with data binding in WPF
	Player.cs - 100%
	Hero.cs - 90%
		Yield() was a solution discovered by a classmate to overcome a freezing GUI
	Villain.cs - 100%
	Table.cs - 100%
		Yield() is included again
	MainWindow.xaml - 100%
	MainWindow.xaml.cs - 100%
	TableWindow.xaml - 90%
		Style - MyBtnStyle is an example found online
	TableWindow.xaml.cs - 100%


There may be a few lines taken from MSDN, and stackoverflow that were used and/or modified in some way. The INotifyPropertyChanged method OnPropertyChanged() is one such example, and the largest. I didn't include this earlier as I believe it's close to a standard implementation
